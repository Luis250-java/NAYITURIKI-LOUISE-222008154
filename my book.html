    <h1>DATABASE AND JAVA OF STUDENTS ATTENDANCE MANAGEMENT SYSTEM</h1>
    <ol><h2><u><li>DATABASE</li></u></h2>
        <p>Database name is: <b>nayituiki_louise_sams.</b></p>
        <ul type="square"><h3><u><i><li>Tables</li></i></u></h3>

            <ol><li><b>INTRODUCTION</b></li>

            <p>In this chapter we will be describing database of Student attendance management system tables inside that database and how those tables were created. In addition, in this chapter we will also show table views from original tables, triggers and stored procedures. Also we will see the relationship between tables in database.</p></br>
            <p>In this chapter we are also going to look on some opperations used on some tables like ADD, DELETE, INSERT ....</p>
<p>To develop this system database there are some programs and programing languagr we used to reach on final output of system as we describe in chapter one. The most used are Xamp saver MySQL.</p>
<p>SECTION I:</p>
<p>ENTITIES</p>
<p>In a Student Attendance Management System, various entities and their corresponding attributes play crucial roles in efficiently tracking and managing student attendance records. Here are the main entities along with their attributes:</p>



            <li><b>User table</b></li>

            <p>This table contains information details about all system's user. It shows attributes like user_id, user_name, password... Information of new users will be kept in this table too.
This table will be created by Admin.</p> </br>


            <li><b>ADMINS TABLE</b></li>

            <p>Admin is an important user in the system. Is one who will control all syatem's operations and user's activities like logins, changing password etc. Also admin will create all tables of system's data base. He can add new user in system, delete leaving one, or updates informations about existing one. So this table (Admins) contain informations about admins.</p></br>

            <li><b>Students table</b></li>

            
<p>The Students table is a vital component, housing comprehensive information about individual students enrolled in the institution. It includes unique student identifiers, full names, registration number and email address.
</p></br>

            <li><b>Attendance table </b></li>

            <p>This table shows attendance details like Students who attended class, date of attendance, course attended etc </p></br>

            <li><b>Classes table</b></li>

            <p>The Classes table serves as a repository for information related to academic classes offered within the institution. It includes details such as unique identifiers, class names, course id, teacher id and class section.</p></br>

<li><b>Course table</b></li> 
  <p>Within the Student Attendance Management System, the Courses table is designed to store essential details about the various courses provided by the institution. This includes unique course identifiers, names, course description and a teacher of that course with specific departments.
 </p></br>

<li><b>Teachers table</b></li>

            <p>The Department table plays a pivotal role by containing details about the academic departments within the institution. It includes unique department identifiers, names, department heads, and physical locations or campuses associated with each department.
</p></br>
<li><b>Departments table</b></li>



                          <h3><u><i><li>LOGICAL DATABASE MODE </li></i></u></h3>
                   <b>The logical data model for the given entities: student, attendance, class/session, course, teacher, admin, user account, and department. This model showcases the relationships between these entities. Note that attributes have been kept concise for brevity.</b></br>
    </br>

   <p> Relationships:</p>
<p>One-to-Many:</p>
<p>One Course has Many Classes</p>
<p>One Teacher teaches Many Courses</p>
<p>One Department has Many Teachers</p>
<p>One Department has Many Courses</p>
<p>One Teacher can be an Admin</p>
<p>Many-to-Many:</p>
<p>Many Students attend Many Classes (Attendance)</p>
<p>One-to-One:</p>
<p>One Student has One User Account</p>
<p>One Teacher has One User Account</p>
<p>One Admin has One User Account</p>
<p>This simplified logical data model captures the main entities, their attributes, and the relationships between them. In a real-world scenario, additional attributes and constraints would be incorporated to create a more comprehensive and accurate model.</p>
<p>ENTITY RELATIONSHIP DIAGRAM</p>
<p>An Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD) for a Student Attendance Management System (SAMS) is a visual representation of the data model that captures the key entities, their attributes, and the relationships among them. ERDs are commonly used in database design to help depict how different elements in a system are related to each other. In the context of a Student Attendance Management System, the ERD would illustrate how students, courses, attendance records, and other relevant entities are interconnected</p>

<p>An Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD) is a visual representation of the data model for a system, which helps to define the relationships between various entities and their attributes. In the context of a Student Attendance Management System, Yhe above ERD t includes the following entities: Students, Teachers, Admin, Courses, Classes, Attendances, and User Accounts.</p>
<p>⦁   Entities:</p>
<p>a. Students: This entity represents the students who are enrolled in courses and attend classes. It may have attributes such as StudentID, Name, Email, and more.
<p>b. Teachers: This entity represents the teaching staff responsible for conducting classes and managing attendance. It may include attributes like TeacherID, Name, Email, and more.
<p>c. Admin: This entity represents the system administrators who manage and oversee the entire attendance management system. It may have attributes such as AdminID, Name, Email, and more.
<p>d. Courses: This entity represents the various courses offered within the system. It may include attributes like CourseID, Course Name, Course Code, and more.
<p>e. Classes: This entity represents individual classes or sessions associated with specific courses. It may have attributes like ClassID, Date, Time, and Room.
<p>f. Attendances: This entity represents the attendance records of students in specific classes. It can include attributes such as AttendanceID, Date, Status (e.g., Present, Absent), and more.
<p>g. User Accounts: This entity represents the user accounts used for authentication and authorization within the system. It may include attributes such as UserID, Username, Password (encrypted), and Role (Student, Teacher, Admin).
<p>⦁   Relationships:</p>
<p>a. Student-Attendance: This is a many-to-many relationship between Students and Attendances because a student can have multiple attendance records, and an attendance record can be associated with multiple students. This relationship is usually resolved through an associative entity/table that keeps track of which students attended which classes.</p>
<p>b. Teacher-Classes: This is a one-to-many relationship between Teachers and Classes, indicating that a teacher can be associated with multiple classes, but each class is taught by one teacher.</p>
<p>c. Admin-User Account: This is a one-to-one relationship between Admin and User Accounts, signifying that each admin has a unique user account for system access.</p>
<p>d. Student-User Account: This is a one-to-one relationship between Students and User Accounts, meaning that each student has a unique user account for system access.</p>
<p>e. Teacher-User Account: This is a one-to-one relationship between Teachers and User Accounts, indicating that each teacher has a unique user account for system access.</p>
<p>f. Course-Classes: This is a one-to-many relationship between Courses and Classes, indicating that a course can have multiple classes associated with it.</p>

<p>⦁   Attributes:</p>
<p>Each entity will have specific attributes associated with it, such as Student Name, Teacher Email, Admin Name, Course Code, Class Date, Attendance Status, User Account Username, and more.</p>
<p>⦁   Cardinality:</p>
<p>Cardinality describes the number of instances of one entity that can be related to the number of instances of another entity through a specific relationship. You'll need to define the cardinality for each relationship (e.g., one-to-one, one-to-many, many-to-many) based on the system's requirements.</p>
<p>This ERD provides a high-level overview of the Student Attendance Management System's data structure, showing how different entities are related to each other and what attributes they possess. Further refinements can be made based on the specific needs and complexity of your system.</p>
<p>JAVA PROGRAMING</p>
<p>INTRODUCTION</p>
<p>In this chapter I will be describing how powerful general purpose programming language was used to create the analyzed system.</p>
<p>In this chapter I will undergo full detail of how everything will function together with database 
that have been describe above and how it cope with full analyzed system.
Tools used to develop this system in java programming:</p>
<p>Eclipse IDE: an integrated development environment used in computer programming. It 
contains a base workspace and an extensible plug-in system for customizing the 
environment. It is the second-most-popular IDE for Java development, and, until 2016, 
was the most popular.</p>
<p>JAR stands for Java Archive. It's a file format based on the popular ZIP file format and 
is used for aggregating many files into one. Although JAR can be used as a general 
archiving tool, the primary motivation for its development was so that Java applets and 
their requisite components.</p>
<p>MySQL Connectors. MySQL provides standards-based drivers for JDBC, ODBC, and 
Net enabling developers to build database applications in their language
 Forms description</p>
So let look together how the system will function one by one from the beginning up to 
the end.</p>
<p>1.Welcome page</p>
<p>This is the first page or dashboard that shows entities engaged in the system</p>
<p>Student Login form</p>
<p>For student to access the system, she/he will need to login using created and allowed 
username and password otherwise no access will be given.</p>
<p>Teacher Login form</p>
<p>And for te acher too, to access the system, she/he will need to login using created and allowed username and password otherwise no access will be given.</p>
<p>Course CRUD form</p>
<p>Operations like create, read, update and deelete is the task of admin. This form, show an example of CRUD operation  done on Course entinty. It may be done on other entities else as it done on course.</p>

<p>View attendence form</p>
<p>After geting an access to a system by logging in, student or teacher can view attendance. This form shows how those user my serach for what they wnt to view and then after thay can close the system.</p>
<p>Conclusion:</p>
<p>By concluding this chapter concerns with java programming especially in my developed 
system, We have seen how my syestem will run, we have seen some button and its uses. I can say that I have final product that I was expecting to have. The 
manipulation of data have gone well even if I meet with many challenges like crushing of xampp, but at least  I finally got a result from my work.  I may expect good feedback from the user.</p>
